## Desktop client for [_Telegram_](https://telegram.org/) 🧑‍💻

**Theta Express** is a desktop client for that Telegram app, that gives most of the basic functionalities in addition to extra features.

> ## **!** _A change has been made to the project constuction._
> This version uses `vite` instead of `webpack`, which was more appropriate for the project and performed better overall.
